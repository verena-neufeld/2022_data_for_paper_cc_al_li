Intermediate post-processing files:
- dzvp_extrap_hf_rev_ccsd_corr.csv : extrapolated DZ CCSD corr energy for anisotropic cell, per 2 atoms
- dzvp_extrap_hf_rev_hf.csv : extrapolated DZ HF energy for cubic cell, per 4 atoms
- single_atom/corr_direct_extrap.csv : extrapolated DZ, TZ, QZ CCSD corr energy of single atom ("direct extrap corr")
- single_atom/hf_direct_extrap.csv : extrapolated DZ, TZ, QZ HF energy of single atom ("direct extrap HF")

Main file for figure 3:
- al_summary_binding_27tz.csv : single atom, bulk (and "corrected" bulk) and cohesive (and "corrected" cohesive) energies for Al. Corrected is correcting energy with extrapolation of 552 and 442 CCSD correlation energy at a=4.05ang. For not corrected energies, the 552 CCSD corr DZ energy is used as the TDL DZ energy.

Intermediate post-processing files:
- dzvp_extrap_ccsd_corr.csv : extrapolated DZ CCSD corr energy, using 333 and 444.
- dzvp_extrap_ccsd_corr_222_333.csv : extrapolated DZ CCSD corr energy, using 222 and 333.
- dzvp_extrap_1sfrozen_ccsd_corr.csv : extrapolated DZ CCSD corr energy, using 333 and 444, with 1s frozen in CCSD calculation.
- dzvp_extrap_1sfrozen_ccsd_corr_222_333.csv : extrapolated DZ CCSD corr energy, using 222 and 333, with 1s frozen in CCSD calculation.
- dzvp_extrap_hf.csv : extrapolated DZ HF energy. 
- single_atom/corr_direct_extrap.csv : extrapolated DZ, TZ, QZ CCSD corr energy of single atom ("direct extrap corr")
- single_atom/hf_direct_extrap.csv : extrapolated DZ, TZ, QZ HF energy of single atom ("direct extrap HF")

Note that when 1s is frozen for the single Li atom, CCSD corr is zero.

Main files for figure 3:
- li_summary_binding_27tz_222_333.csv : single atom, bulk (and "corrected" bulk) and cohesive (and "corrected" cohesive) energies for Li. For DZ, 222-333 extrapolated CCSD corr energies are used for CCSD corr. Corrected is correcting DZ CCSD corr energy with 333-444 DZ CCSD corr extrapolation at a=3.5ang. 
- li_summary_binding_27tz_svc_222_333.csv : Using information from li_summary_binding_27tz_222_333.csv and li_summary_binding_27tz_1sfrozen_222_333.csv, CCSD-SVC was evaluated and shown here. See li_summary_binding_27tz_222_333.csv for more.
(- li_summary_binding_27tz_1sfrozen_222_333.csv : similar to li_summary_binding_27tz_222_333.csv but with 1s frozen for CCSD.)


How to plot figure 3:
=====================
For al, plot volume ("a"^3/4) against "coh_corrected_en" for these selections:
method: "CCSD", basis: "qzv3p_f" for CCSD QZ
method: "CCSD", basis: "cbs" for CCSD
method: "CCSD+(T)", basis: "cbs" for CCSD(T)_SR
method: "CCSD-SAC", basis: "cbs" for CCSD-SVC ("SAC" is historic, ignore this discrepancy)

for li, plot volume ("a^3/2") against "coh_corrected_en" for these selections:
method: "CCSD", basis: "qzv3p" for CCSD QZ (from li_summary_binding_27tz_222_333.csv)
method: "CCSD", basis: "cbs" for CCSD (from li_summary_binding_27tz_222_333.csv)
method: "CCSD+(T)", basis: "cbs" for CCSD(T)_SR (from li_summary_binding_27tz_222_333.csv)
method: "CCSD-SVC", basis: "cbs" for CCSD-SVC (from li_summary_binding_27tz_svc_222_333.csv)
