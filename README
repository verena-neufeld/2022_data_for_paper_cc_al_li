This repository contains the basis sets optimised and (soon - todo) data generated in "V. A. Neufeld, H.-Z. Ye, T. C. Berkelbach, Ground-State Properties of Metallic Solids from Ab Initio Coupled-Cluster Theory", J. Phys. Chem. Lett. (accepted).

The basis sets are found in "basis_sets". As described in the paper, they were optimised starting from GTH basis sets by [1] (gth-dzvp, gth-tzv2p, gth-qzv3p for DZ, TZ, QZ - plus an f function for TZ and QZ Al) and therefore have similarities with these basis sets.
