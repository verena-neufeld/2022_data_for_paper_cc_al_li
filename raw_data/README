These csv files have data extracted from calculations, for lithium (li) and aluminium (al).
*1sfrozen* contains data where the 1s electrons were frozen in the post HF calculations.
single_atom contains data from the unrestricted calculations involving only a single atom.

The calculations were run at the Baldereschi twist angle, at the cubic one for li and isotropic cell al, and at the FCC one for anisotropic cell al.
The li pseudopotential was "gth-pade" and the one for al "gth-hf-rev".

Explanations of columns:

a: lattice parameter in angstrom
E_HF: HF energy (ha)
E_CCSD_corr: CCSD correlation energy (ha)
Nk: ignore this column
kpts: k point mesh, e.g. 333 for a 3x3x3 mesh
basis: basis, li and al dz: "dzvp", li tz: "tzv2p", al tz: "tzv2p_f", li qz: "qzv3p", al qz: "qzv3p_f"
E_CCSD: total CCSD energy (ha)
KMP2 corr: MP2 correlation energy (ha)
t_corr: (T) contribution to correlation energy (ha)
Nk_str: k point mesh, e.g. 333 for a 3x3x3 mesh
note: Some comments

nshells: Number of shells of ghost atoms around single atom studied
box_length: Length of side of cubic unit cell for single atom calculation.
